To build this on Raspberry Pi OS, Flask is a great choice for the backend, along with HTML5 and JavaScript for the frontend. Here’s an outline of how each feature can be implemented:

1. Record Audio
Frontend: Use JavaScript for audio recording and capturing metadata (filename, description, and category). HTML5 provides built-in media handling for capturing audio via the <input type="file" accept="audio/*"> element.
Backend: Create a Flask endpoint to handle the upload. This endpoint can save audio files and store metadata (filename, description, and category) in a simple SQLite database, making it lightweight for Raspberry Pi.
2. Organize Workout
Frontend: Display audio files grouped by category, allowing users to filter, select files, and assign a new category.
Backend: Create a Flask route that retrieves audio metadata from the database for displaying and organizing. A save endpoint will allow saving lists of files as a workout, including name, description, and category.
3. Start Workout
Frontend: Provide a list of available workouts to select from. On selection, show a “Start” button that plays files in sequence.
Backend: A Flask endpoint could retrieve the workout file list from the database, enabling the frontend to load and play the files in order.
Getting Started
Setup Flask on Raspberry Pi: Install Flask using pip install flask.
Database Setup: Use SQLite for storing audio metadata and workout information.
Audio Handling: Use libraries like pydub for handling and managing audio files if necessary, especially if you want to process or play files in Python directly.

Make sure to have Flask and necessary libraries installed on your Raspberry Pi:
pip install flask pydub

We'll also need to install ffmpeg for audio processing with pydub:
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg





Explanation of scripts.js
Recording Audio:

startRecording() uses the MediaRecorder API to capture audio input.
The recording stops when the "record" button is clicked, which then calls saveRecording() to upload the audio file along with metadata.
Saving Audio to the Server:

saveRecording(audioBlob) collects metadata (file name, description, category) and sends the recorded audio as a POST request to the server.
Filtering Audio Files:

filterAudioByCategory(category) filters audio files on the Organize Workout page based on the selected category.
Playing Workout Files in Sequence:

playWorkout(fileList) takes a list of audio files from a workout and plays each one sequentially, with playAudio() returning a promise that resolves after the file finishes.
Integrating scripts.js
Recording Button in record_audio.html: Add an "onClick" event to trigger startRecording() when the user wants to start recording.

Filter Selector in organize_workout.html: Add a dropdown or input to select categories and call filterAudioByCategory().

Start Button in start_workout.html: Add code to call playWorkout() with the selected workout’s audio file paths.
